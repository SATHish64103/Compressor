# Compressor
This is an audio compressor developed in MATLAB r2021b for the 2023 AES Student Plugin competition, which secured the bronze award. The compressor is developed as a VST plugin, seamlessly importable and compactable with any audio editing software. It offers a range of tunable parameters - compression threshold, ratio, knee width, attack time, release time, and makeup gain, which can be adjusted by the user in real-time audio control and enhancement.
